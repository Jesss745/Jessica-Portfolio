                <p> This project was created for a Information Design class where I learnt how to visually translate textual, numerical and evidentiary information as needed within its context. Our client, Candlelight Concert, is a musical experience where classically trained musicians perform illuminated by candlelight in a beautiful location. </p>

                <p> <strong> This project is not affiliated with Candlelight Concert in any way. It is a case study done for an academic project </strong> </p>

          <h2>Design Problem</h2>
          <p> Currently, Candlelight Concert has incosistent branding throughout their various sites. In our case, we noticed the Vancouver site did not convey the same design language that Candlelight primary uses for their main site. It is also difficult for users to gain information regarding the concert based on how the webpage is structured. As such, we wanted to simplify the process of purchasing tickers and create a cohesive microsite that communicates the experience of Candlelight Concerts. <p>

            <h2>Precendece Research</h2>
            <p> Our process began by looking into other website for inspiration; Mathilda Gomas for their use of imagery and color in presenting information, Eduardo Luna for the way images are layeered and connect it with type, and Philipp Anthony for their navigation menu. We wanted our website to contain musical elements while remaining unique and easy to navigate for users. </p>
            <p> We also did some ARC research to look at patterns that broke the grid, played more with musical influence, and contained a more fluid design language </p>

            <h3>Framing the Problem </h3>
            <p> We wanted to ensure our microsite properly communicates to potential patrons the unique experience of the Candlelight Concert series, as such, our design must reflect that. There was 2 sub goals we must achieve to complete our primary goal. </p>
            <p> First, we must ensure that the branding of the website conveys the warm feeling candlelight provides by using graphical illustrations that relate to musical instruments, minimal color palette and type that communicates a modern take on a classical music experience.</p>
            <p> Secondly, we wanted to provide an enjoyable user experience by focusing on conveying the candlelight experience first and then transactional process secondary.</p>

            <img class="process-image right" src="img/candlelight-design-process.png"  alt="Our iterations before the final design">
            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p> We first began developing our design language based in part with candle imagery and a decomposition study of Garangula gallery from behance. We wanted to ensure that we remain consistent with Candlelight Concert's primary design language but simultaneously making it unique to help the Vancouver site still stand out as its own unique microsite. We also developed a music staff element to match the musicality provided by the experience.</p>

            <img class="process-image-special" src="img/candlelight-style-text.png" alt="screenshot of the font template for any designs in this project">

            <p> From there, we divided our work. We assigned different members different web pages to iterate upon that we want to have for our final solution. I was responsible for iterating the individual showpage which would have a place where website visitors can immediately purchase tickets. My process began b creating wireframes before then iterating upon the designs using proper imagery and new assets as it goes on.</p>

            <img class="process-image right" src="img/candlelight-wireframe.png" alt="screenshot of the wireframes of the page">
            <p> On top of working with the layout, I wanted to ensure that visitors to get a preview of the type of music they'd be listening to if they were to visit our webpage. As such, I created a piano graphic where when clicked, a snippet from the concert would play with notes. I animated the piano in acordance to "Merry-Go-Round of Life" from Howl's Moving Castle as it wuld be in theme for the page I'm designing. </p>

            <img class="process-image middle" src="img/candlelight-piano.gif" alt="a gif of the piano animation created for this specific page.">

            <p> For this project, part of our responsibility is to create the website into an actual coded website that is hosted online. I was responsible for creating our code style guide, creating the base html structure, and handled the majority of the css portion of the code due to my previous experience working with HTML. To help simplify the coding process, I created code templates for layouts that are repeated throughout our final solution to help reduce the amount of time needed to create the final website. </p>

            <img class="process-image right" src="img/candlelight-mywork.png" alt="an example of how the final website looks like">
            <h2>Final Solution</h2>
            <p> Our final solution implemented core design principles to help users navigate the website while ensuring the website remains pleasing to navigate through. We used several design principles such as asymmetry, peak-end rule, and law of proximity, in order to make the experience enjoyable for users.</p>
            <img class="process-image right" src="img/candlelight-design-principles.png" alt="a list of how various principles used in our design">

            <p> Candlelight's goal as a business is always to receive profits and in this case, they receive this through ticket sales made for their show. As such, we wanted to ensure that our website has a clear call to action that is unique and encourages users to click it. We've done this by creating a CTA button that is animated and relates to Candlelight's branding</p>
            <p> We also ensured that our final website was responsive for 4 major sizes; large screens, laptop, tablets, and phones. This is done with the assumption that most of our users will primarily be accessing our website for. </p>

            <h2>Project Takeaways</h2>
            <p> This project helped me improve my front-end development skills and the importance of creating website designs that are actually implementable. As designers, I believe I have a tendency to create designs without considering how plausible that design is. It also taught me a lot about teamwork and how to share files effectively with my teammates to ensure everything remains up to date. </p> 
            <p> Due to limited time-constraints, we were unable to fully ensure our website is responsive all throughout. Some parts of the page, such as our navigation bar, is slightly faulty during certain screen sizes. In future projects, I would also push for a final user testing to be done on our final product before we release it. </p>
