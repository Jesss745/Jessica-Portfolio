                <p> This project was created for an Interaction Design Methods class where we helped a company come up with a solution for a problem they're facing. My responsibility within this project was handling the art direction of our design. Whether it’s all of our posters, presentation slides, and final design of the design solution, which was a Digital Lookbook.</p>

          <h2>Design Problem</h2>
          <p> Livestock’s online website (deadstock.ca) is really easy to navigate through and recognizable at a glance for those familiar with the brand. </p>
          <p> However, Livestock informed us that they are facing issues with maintaining a loyal customer base as well as reducing the rate of online returns done by customers. Combine that with their already niche audience, its difficult for customers to gain new customers for their website. They also want to stand our more as an online retailer to remain competitive in the ever expanding market. <p>

        <div class="section-dividers-explain">
            <img class="process-image right" src="img/livestock-returns.png" alt="a pie chart of the return data set for livestock">
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p> Internal data provided by Livestock shows that for 10.6% of their returns occur due to customers ordering the wrong sizes and 7.2% because they changed their mind.</p>
            <p> This is in stark contrast to their in-person store where their store staff states that they don’t have an issue with returns and exchanges. They believe that this is due to the connections they've built with customers through conversations, ensuring that customers keep coming back and will leave the store satisfied.</p>
            <p> I helped gather initial user research insights through interviews and competitive analysis. Through this I created initial user flows. I led the visual and interaction design of our first solution, from initial ideation to prototype. I contributed to the interaction design of our second solution. Finally, we presented our solutions to the teaching faculty for feedback and critique. </p>

            <img class="process-image" src="img/livestock-community-values.png" alt="the various community values we found from talking to Livestock's customers">

            <h3> Reframing the Problem </h3>
            <p> Later on, Livestock informed us that they aimed to push more clothing sales in 2024. </p>
            <p> As such, we decided that our design focus will be creating a product, in this case a lookbook, to help Livestock build a connection with their customers while allowing customers to fulfil their goal. </p>

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p> We began our process by narrowng down the goals that we wanted to achieve with our design. From there, we came up with the art direction for our design through researching LIVESTOCK's fonts, brand colors, and design language. I was responsble for assmbling our style guide in order to ensure we remain consistent with the brand</p>

            <img class="process-image-style" src="img/livestock-style-color.png"  alt="screenshot of the colors that can be used for any designs in this project">

            <p> Our interview with potential users allowed us to group Livestock into 3 archetypes with different goals and needs. However, We noticed that their end goal is always to have clothing that they enjoy. These interviews also allowed me to figure out the values that this community treasures </p>
            <img class="process-image-style middle" src="img/livestock-persona.png"  alt="screenshot of three archetypes we divided our target audience to">

            <p> The values of the streetwear community was further solidified when we did participatory workshops with potential users, current customers, and Livestock staff. In order to dig deeper into intrinsic needs of the company, we had 3 activities we asked participants to do. The biggest takeaway we gained from that workshop was what information participants look for when purchasing clothes online. In this scenario, our participants really value knowing how an item fits in comparisson to a person. Whether they're true to size or oversized for example. On top of that, having multiple pictures as a reference on how the object would look in person. </p>
            <img class="process-image" src="img/livestock-workshop.png"  alt="screenshot of the cards sorted for the process">

             <p> After receiving approval from LIVESTOCK to continue with our process, we began iterating upon a design for our final Interactive Lookbook Design. </p>
             <P> I was responsible for creating a user flow for how a user would hypothetically navigate through a digital lookbook just for us to see whether our idea was viable and allowed LIVESTOCK to tell us what interactions they want to add or remove. </p>
            <img class="process-image-style middle" src="img/livestock-userflow.png"  alt="screenshot of our userflow for an interactive lookbook">

            <p> Within every stage of the process, we worked together and created all of our designs. I oversaw the the design process our weekly deliverables and final solution. We iterated upon each others' version, chosing what we decide was the best part of each others before coming together and choosing what we like best from each others. </p>

            <h2>Final Solution</h2>
            <p> Our final product is a seasonally recurring Interactive Lookbook accessible through their website. The Lookbook features fit collections of the season and the behind each product. We implemented a horizontal scrolling site create an experience akin to reading through a book, allowing LIVESTOCK to stand out competitors. </p>
            <img class="process-image" src="img/livestock-final-solution1.png" alt="an example of how the customer can see all the looks being offered in the lookbook">
            <p> The layout of the website is very simple, but still uses strong images to lead the eyes through the page. We aim to encourage customers from clicking on the product to learn more and potentially purchase them. </p>

            <h2>Project Takeaways</h2>
            <p>The project taught a lot on how to do research when it comes to creating user centric designs. I learnt that there is so many methods of gaining information from users as well as how I can design effectively for my potential users. I truly learnt the importance on why creating the right design isso crucial to me as a designer.</p>
            <p> Moving forward, I would love to further refine my prototype and create more pages that we’re currently missing. It'd also been great to do more in depth user testing on our final product before presenting it to Livestock. Regardless, I do believe that this design can help LIvestock remain competitive in the ever expanding space of streetwear fashion retailers</p>
